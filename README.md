About
======
A fully Rails 3.1+ compliant application template used to setup a new Rails app using Paul Irish's HTML5 Boilerplate (http://html5boilerplate.com/)<br>
This template can be considered an upgrade of the Rails 3.0.x application template found here: https://github.com/russfrisch/Rails-HTML5-Boilerplate-Template<br>

How to Use
===========
Run directly from github:<br>
`rails new <appname> -m https://github.com/russfrisch/h5bp-rails/raw/master/h5bp.rb`<br>

What this Template Does
========================
This template does the following:

1.  Downloads HTML5 Boilerplate index.html and merges it with the default application.html.erb Rails generates.
2.  Downloads HTML5 Boilerplate style.css and merges it with the default application.css Rails generates.
3.  Downloads a version of the HTML5 Boilerplate plugins.js converted to CoffeeScript
4.  Downloads HTML5 Boilerplate misc. assets: icons, .htaccess, etc.
5.  Updates Gemfile to include Modernizr-Rails which provides the Modernizr.js dependency HTML5 Boilerplate uses.

Push Requests
==============
If there is anything that can be done better or you would like to see tweaked, please send me a push request.
